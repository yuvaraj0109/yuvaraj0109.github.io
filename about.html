        <p>
    I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at <b>Easwari Engineering College</b>,
    currently in my <b>2nd year</b>, with a consistent <b>CGPA of 8.66/10.0</b>.
    My interest in technology is driven by a curiosity to understand how systems work
    at a deeper level and a strong desire to solve real-world problems through software.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I have a solid foundation in <b>Java</b> and am actively specializing in
    <b>Java Full Stack Development</b>, with hands-on experience in <b>Spring Boot</b>
    and modern backend practices. I am continuously working on projects that help me
    strengthen my understanding of application architecture, backend logic,
    and data flow.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Alongside development, I am deeply focused on improving my
    <b>problem-solving skills</b>. I am currently practicing
    <b>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</b> and solving problems on
    <b>LeetCode</b>, aiming to write efficient, optimized, and scalable code.
